Guidelines:

Being a dummy:
If you make a username and it’s offensive, inappropriate, or just bad, you’re just getting yourself in trouble.

Being weird or gross:
If you do weird things like stalk people, go on inappropriate websites or search for indecent things, it’s your fault if none wants to be near you or don’t like you.

Being self-detrimental:
Whatever you post online, a status, photo, video, personal information like addresses, phone numbers, wily schedules, everyone else can see it, so do it at your own risk. Keep your information safe and private.



Netizenship:

If you’re a jerk to people, they’ll be jerks to you:
Be careful with other people’s stuff, including the school’s stuff, be careful with programs, files, and the system as well as the computer itself, downloading random stuff on purpose and trying to make a virus aren't very nice.

If you bully people, expect people to hate you:
using the internet to mess with people or to make them feel bad, making fun of people for what they post, making fun of people in general, online or not are all forms of bullying. Helping people bully others is also bullying, helping other people be mean or be jerks is a bad idea, tell someone like a teacher, your parents, or an adult if there are people not being nice and trying to hurt other people especially if they’re trying to bully you.

Piracy is a crime:
If you can, ask for permission before you use something, if you get information from somewhere, say where you got it from, or else it’ll be plagiarism. If you can, use free sources instead of pirating, downloading, or finding some way to get the “hacked” or “cracked” version. You don’t want to be a criminal do you?
